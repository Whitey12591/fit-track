//The screens folder holds many different folders, each of which corresponds to a different screen of the app. Each screen folder holds three things: a primary screen file which serves to organize each component, a BLoC file that is only used for that screen, and a “components” folder that holds each component file used by the screen. Any section of a screen more complicated then a few widgets should be its own component, and some very complex components may even require their own BLoC file and components as a screen does.
